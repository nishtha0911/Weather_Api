# Weather_ApI
# 🌦️ Weather Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a weather dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from historical weather data using data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identifying weather patterns and conditions
- Time-based trends (e.g., monthly averages, seasonal patterns)
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced and attractive plots

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `weather dataset analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis
- `weather.csv` *(optional)* – the dataset used (if not included, add download instructions)
- `README.md` – project documentation

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- What is the average temperature over time?
- How does humidity, wind speed, or precipitation vary seasonally?
- What are the most common weather conditions?
- Are there patterns over months or years?

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes several charts such as:
- Line plots for temperature trends
- Histograms for weather condition frequencies
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis

---

## 🧠 Insights & Observations

This section highlights any patterns discovered, such as:
- Temperature spikes or drops
- High humidity months
- Correlations between weather variables

## 📌 How to Run

1. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   Launch the notebook:

2.open bash adn write 
jupyter notebook

3.Open weather dataset analysis.ipynb and run all cells.
